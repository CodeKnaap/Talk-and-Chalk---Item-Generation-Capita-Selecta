# Talk and Chalk: Procedural Item Generation with AI

This project explores whether pre-trained generative AI models can be combined into a modular pipeline to generate a complete 2D game object for Unity ‚Äî from input prompt and sketch to sprite, description, animation, and behavior.

## Project Goal

Create a 2D sword (in pixel-art style) based on a sketch and text prompt. The generated object ideally includes:

- A consistent, style-matching sprite
- A short flavor text (e.g., lore/description)
- A simple attack animation
- Unity-ready code defining the object‚Äôs functionality

## What Was Done

- ‚úÖ **Prompt + sketch input** via Gradio interface
- ‚úÖ **Sprite generation** using ControlNet + PixelArt SDXL
- ‚ùå **Unity C# code generation** attempted via StarCoder/Gwen2 but not successful
- üîç **Flavor text and animation generation** were researched but not implemented

## ‚ö†Challenges

- Code generation proved difficult without structured constraints
- LLMs often reproduced prompts verbatim or generated invalid code
- Fine-tuning and stricter templates likely needed for consistent Unity integration
